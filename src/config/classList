# This file uses the java.util.Properties syntax.  Leading # and ! characters
# denote comments.  The = or : characters are used to separate keys from
# values.  Backslashes are used to escape whitespace, control characters
# (like #, =, etc), as well as continue a logical line definition onto multiple
# natural lines.

# The semantics of this file is "display name = class name", where display name
# is the text to be shown indicating when indicating a particular metadata
# class.  The class name must be fully qualified.

# This is the standard DC class
DC=fedora.services.sipcreator.metadata.DublinCore
# This is a simple text metadata model
