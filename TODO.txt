   General System:
   * Remove cruft libraries.  Log4j?
   * Saving of SIP file
D    * How to get the "type" in the structMap section of the METS file
       - Type field explicity part of Metadata class now
     * What to do about unknown mime types?
     * Should there be a human readable relationship between file id's and their
       component metadata id's?
     * Fix the header creation
     * How do we attach multiple metadata records to the root of the tree?
   * Loading of a SIP file
   * MIME Type detection

       * Evaluate usefulness
     * Tool linked from Sandy
       * Evaluate usefulnes
   * Integrate JHove
   * Make sure that the different "task" views all update the same data, and
     propagate the changes from the data to all of the non-current views
D    * Between File System and Metadata tasks
       * Do a more intelligent model update, than "structure changed" on root...
De * Save file's metadata beyond directory switching?
D    * At least show a warning dialog when switching directories
D  * Close all metadata tabs when switching

   File Selection Task:
   * Bug: Collapsing a branch that causes a scroll event also causes a selection event
   * Allow web directories too
D  * Find a way to hide unselected files
D  * Integrate Filtering
D  * Fix ellipses (...) problem when selecting tree nodes
D  * Remove "Unchecked Boxes Hidden" button
D  * Reorder view; directories first
D  * Make sure to deselect all nodes
D  * Lazy tree evaluation
De   * Alternate: threaded loading approach (still need lazy for web dirs)


   Filtering Subtask:
D  * Inclusion/Exclusion patterns for mass (de)selection of files
Dx * Using a dialog
D  * Using a real regex language
D  * Escape . to mean \. and * to mean .*

   Metadata Entry Task:
   * Develop automatic generation of metadata
     * Based on location in hierarchy?
     * Based on Parent's metadata?
     * Based on System aspects? (time, etc)
     * Based on global values (always use the same creator, etc)
D  * Use hideable panels
D  * Change tab wrap style to scroll
D  * Just use hints for metadata tabs
D  * Use METS ID safe strings (no ":", " ", and limit length to 64)
     - Used unique number (unique across JVM)
D  * Integrate Filtering
D  * Present nicer view of available metadata formats
D  * UI Widget for editing metadata names
D  * Allow for display and editing of mime type
D  * Reorder view; directories first
D  * Avoid tab name collisions
D  * DC Metadata format
D    * Use pull down boxes for first field of DC Table
D    * Sorting within table
D    * Primitive way of "saving" table data into the actual DCFields instance
D  * Develop generic metadata API so that new formats can be "dropped in"

   CRules Task:
   * Allow for a way to check relationships of two nodes
   * Allow for propogation of new rules back into XML file
     * Based on Node name?
     * Based on Node "type"?
   * Allow for a way to save new CRules.xml
   * Allow for visualization of graph
     * Allow for relationship classes to be individually viewable
   * More complicated primitive relationships?
     * Chains of currently used relationships?
     * Subset of XPath?
     * New language?
D  * Allow for new datastream templates to be created (visible in metadata entry task)
D  * Allow for files on web, not just local files
D  * Refix annoying start sizes for CRules HideablePanels
D  * Merge Datastream/Object template panels
D  * Position relationship list at bottom right of DOT panel
D  * Import it
D  * Slightly confusing/inaccurate way of representing primitiveRels
